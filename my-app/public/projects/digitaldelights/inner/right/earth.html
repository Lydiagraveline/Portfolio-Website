    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p><a href="right.html">menu</a></p>
    <p>
      The foreground: earth, with multiple pageants of the presumption of earhty
      authority and its catastophix results.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the case of the first two panels, the bottom portion of the panel
      represents earth and its conditions; man and the influences he operates
      under.

    <div class="half">
      <p>
        The overall theme: the perversion of God's authority by man's authority
      </p>
      <p>Sheild with pierced hand = meaning ok society</p>
      <p>
        Hand = hand of god, symbol of his word, is severed and stabbed witgh a
        knife. blue sheild = materialism and earhtly influences
      </p>
      <p>
        Dice at its figertips indicate that man plays with God's words and laws
        as though they were a game
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="width:40%;">
      <p> eve is now a drunkard and a gambler. </p>
      <p> From here on, she slides even further downhill </p>
    </div>
    <img src="images/earth3.png" alt="earth" width="600px;" />
    <p>A man under the influence of mistaken religious authourites </p>
    <p>Signing his soul away, perhaps to the devil himself. </p>

    <p>The Pageant of Earthly Justice</p>
    <p>A group of musicians, playing grotesquely oversized instruments. Like in the Center
    panel, bosch uses outsized objects to represent producrs on man's imagination.</p>
    <p>
    What we see is an attemot by a man to ompose the music of human justice, produces by the corruption of his own intelligence, within life. The whole process becomes a mockery of divine
    justice.
  </p>
<p>The judge--clothed in pink, to indicate he thinks he's God -- lashes out the musical letter of the laws
on the butt of another defendant with his tonge. </p>

    <p>We are not just headed for Hell; we are in a hurry to get there, ice-skating, as though it were a leisure activity.  </p>
    <p>The more effort we make, the faster we go. And the ones with better eqipement get there first. Its not just a path to divine judgemebnt; it's a race. </p>
